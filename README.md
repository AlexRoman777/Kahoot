This is a digital version of the game where the teacher asks a question and students answer by raising a card. With this app, there's no need to search for the right card - simply tap the screen, raise your phone, and show your answer.

Visit the [Offline Kahoot](https://alexroman777.github.io/Kahoot/) webapp and you're all set!
